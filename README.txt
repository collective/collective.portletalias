Introduction
============

Allow "alias" portlets from other locations to show in the current folder in `Plone CMS <http://plone.org>`_.
This is useful if you need to have the same portlet to pop-up in different unrelated locations
and you want to have only one copy for the site editors to maintain the portlet content.

* Go to Manage portlets

* Choose Add new portlet... Alias

* Enter the path to the source folder

* Enter the portlet id of the source portlet. This add-on provides @@portlet-data view which dumps
  out the folder portlet info and related its.

Installation
